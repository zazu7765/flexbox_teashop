# flexbox_teashop

 teashop website with flexbox  
 made with raw html/css, images provided by codecademy  

## backstory

 originally, this was supposed to be a project that you follow to work on your flexbox skills in how they wanted the website to look,but the example redline print that they gave me was pretty outdated in terms of modern styles and how the *vibe* of the shop was supposed to feel.  

 so, i changed a bunch of the styles and made it my own.  

yay for open ended projects !
